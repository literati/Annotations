#Annotations for Omeka
The Annotations plugin is a minimal wrapper for the [Annotator](https://github.com/okfn/annotator) javascript library developed by
[the Open Knowledge Foudation](http://okfn.org/).  
This project provides the minimal infrastructure needed to use this library in an Omeka project.
